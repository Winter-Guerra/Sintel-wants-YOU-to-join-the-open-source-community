This is the Blend, GIMP and final JPG files for my Sintel open source photo. It is all released under the CC_BY_SA license and only uses open source material. Massive props to the Blender Foundation and Blender Institute for making such an AWESOME movie and releasing all of its software and models under an open source license!
